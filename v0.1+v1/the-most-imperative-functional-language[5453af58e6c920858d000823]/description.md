# A monster's story

Frank N. Stein likes to cobble together different paradigms and languages. This time, he thought about the factorial, and quickly wrote down
```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = def $ do
  result <- var 1
  i      <- var n
  while i (>0) $ do
    result *= i
    i      -= lit 1
  return result
```
Pleased with his solution, he orders you to take it and use it in your program. The caveat? He want's the program in __Haskell__. If you don't manage it he'll use your brain to create a new warrior, so lets get to work.

# Task
Your task is to write `def`, `var`, `lit`, `while` and the arithmetical operators. Note that the operators should take both a variable (created with `var`) or a literal as right hand side:
```haskell
def $ do
  a <- var 1
  b <- var 2
  a += b
  a += lit 1
  return a 
-- should be 4
```
Note that the initial solution won't contain type signatures. It's up to you to determine or create the needed types. All values will be `Integer`.

Your operators will be tested on three functions.

# Remarks
Although this kata shows that it's possible to write Haskell in an imperative way, don't start doing this everywhere.
Mutability is a nice feature sometimes, but GHC can optimize your usual non-mutable Haskell code pretty well.
Also, always benchmark first, optimize later.

The title is inspired by [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6622524/why-is-haskell-sometimes-referred-to-as-best-imperative-language)

# Hints
## Some type hints
```haskell
data SomeMonad   a
data SomeVariable

def   :: SomeMonad (SomeVariable a) -> Integer
var   :: a -> SomeMonad (SomeVariable a)
lit   :: a -> (SomeVariable a)
while :: (SomeVariable a) -> (a -> Bool) -> SomeMonad () -> SomeMonad ()

(+=), (-=), (*=) :: (SomeVariable a) -> ??? -> SomeMonad ()
```
Feel free to use any other approach or types, as long as the functions are semantical correct.
