We will walk through the definition of isomorphism and define some common isomorphisms. It is closely related to bijection (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection).

This kata possibly unlocks: [Algebraic Isomorphism](https://www.codewars.com/kata/algebraic-isomorphism), [Peano And Church](https://www.codewars.com/kata/peano-and-church/).

Note: this kata is significantly easier in Haskell and PureScript than in any other language. We won't reply at complaints for other languages unless you have completed it in Haskell and/or PureScript. 

P.S. The tests are **CORRECT**. There are some easy-to-make mistakes (see the discussion area). Please figure out how to solve this yourself.

Detailed instructions are written in the comments of the initial solution.

If you are stuck then you can try to look at [Bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) for intuition.
