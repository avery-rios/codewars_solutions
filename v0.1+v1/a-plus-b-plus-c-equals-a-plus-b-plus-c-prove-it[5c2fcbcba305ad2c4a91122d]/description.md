_Note to translators: This Kata is **NOT** accepting any translations to Coq / Idris / Agda / Lean due to the huge difference in difficulty between Haskell and those languages mentioned. Any translations violating this rule will be rejected without further reason._

Inspired from the [a+b=b+a](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59db393bc1596bd2b700007f/) kata, and this one is much simpler.

The definition of natural numbers are all the same, the only difference is the theorem to be proved.
This time we're gonna prove the plus associative law.
