How can "Double Negation Elimination" related to "Principle of Excluded Middle"? Both of them are not axioms in intuitionistic logic and we can't prove them.

But at least we can prove that both of them are implied by each other!

Just reminder. We assume "Principle of Non-Contradiction". That is ```absurd :: Void -> a``` in haskell (preloaded, no need to `import Data.Void` again). You need this axiom to complete the proof.
