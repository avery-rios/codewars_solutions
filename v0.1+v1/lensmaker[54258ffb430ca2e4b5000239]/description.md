Implement a small ("van Laarhoven" style) lens library including lenses, prisms, traversals, folds, and isos.

Lenses, or "functional references" are a toolkit for "focusing" on inner parts of values. By constructing a set of lenses which provide focus on the basic elementary parts of any type you define you can compose these into more sophisticated lenses which probe into deeply nested types.

Generalizations of lenses include

* Traversals: lenses which focus on 0, 1, or many inner pieces of the same type
* Folds: computations which "get" from 0, 1, or many inner pieces and summarize them somehow
* Prisms: lenses which focus on 0 or 1 inner pieces, lenses which can fail
* Isos: lenses which witness a subpart which is equal to the whole---witnesses of isomorphisms between subparts and wholes

This challenge asks that you produce a small, but comprehensive, lens library.

**Irrelevant hints**: Add `{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-}` so you can use `(, a)` instead of `\x -> (x, a)` in your code.

**Relevant hint**: you can implement `set` and `to` by using `over` and `coerce` respectively.
